## Original Notes to myself (as a beginner in coding)

- Find a practical exercice to practice my beginner coding skills
- Setup a working space physically and virtually (Visual Studio Code, github repository, nice clean desk...)
- Build an app that provides some value and launch it in a marketplace
- Read Google Play Store requirements in their documentation
- Stay __lean__, don't overcomplicate things
- __No errors__ in the code before calling it a day
- Setup a __deadline__

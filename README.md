Go to [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eth.uniworld.UpToYou) and download it for free!

## Original Notes to myself (as a beginner in coding)

- Find a practical exercice to practice my beginner coding skills
- Setup a working space physically and virtually (Visual Studio Code, github repository, nice clean desk...)
- Build an app that provides some value and launch it in a marketplace
- Read Google Play Store requirements in their [documentation](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/launch-checklist)
- Stay [__lean__](http://theleanstartup.com/principles), don't overcomplicate things
- __No errors__ in the code before calling it a day
- Setup a __deadline__

## What it took me to make it happen

- [Codecademy- _learn Javascript_](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) (if you are a complete beginner like me, here's a free course online)
- [Codecademy- _learn ReactJS_](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) (free introduction course to ReactJS, similar to React Native)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) (super useful to train your coding skills)
### Tools I used
- macbook Air 2011
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (where I write my code)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- [React-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) (framework for building native mobile apps with javascript)
- [Vectr](https://vectr.com/) (free online vector software. I used it to design the coin and the dice)
- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
- A nice desk and a yoga ball

## Conclusion

Totally worth it, but very painful at times. 

I spent probably 10 minutes on the actual coding and 99% of my time just researching and trying and failing. Total time spend: a month.

Good news is, there is so much information out there so just be specific when it comes to asking the questions in internet, so many people have already been through / asked the same thing...

I originally had a very ambitious idea, and eventually I had to go simpler and simpler, since the goal was to launch an [MVP](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/02/27/what-is-a-minimum-viable-product-and-why-do-companies-need-them/#d0a18af382ca); at some point I had to made a step back, breath and think through what was enough to become an app (basically I tried to avoid fancy features, that would just overcomplicate my life).
In the end... tadah! Mission accomplished, happy me. üéâ


I want to work on a newer version of it, as it has a few things to improve for sure.
But currently working on [Evok](https://github.com/lydialawli/Evok), my next mobile app after Up To You :)

Comments and feedbacks are highly appreciated üôèüèª
